# üõ† Requirements

Before starting the software you need to do two very important things:

- Make sure you have Arduino Leonardo R3 ATMEGA32U4.
- Download the Zip file from the repository and extract in a folder(at the end you will need to have "<strong>1.ico, config.ini, setup.exe</strong>").

# :joystick: Setup

- Plug in the Arduino into the PC.
- Start setup.exe
- Select to start the setup and wait to load completely.
- After that you will need to choose your VID and PID mouse numbers. (Check below if you don't know how.)
- Hit enter and wait to say it's finished.
